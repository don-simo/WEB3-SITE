As we can see from this introductory phrase on the website, the enigmatic atmosphere is dominant and our engagement is necessary in order to unlock the mysteries of this project. It is true that we do not know yet if the project is merely art-based or if there are any plans for utility, because the team does not share much more information. But even though this seems quite odd for a new project, I find it really clever. And the fact that the hidden information is a tool to build a strong community and not just hype makes it an interesting growth approach.</p>

In my opinion it is joyful since it reminds me of my childhood cartoons, which I used to watch. In particular, we can see many samples depicting portraits of the Mallards with various traits, from a Pharaoh to a Cardinal. And if you are wondering about the coloring, take a look below. The contrast and tones contribute to this high-quality results.

BAYC is an interesting and stylish NFT project developed by Yuga Labs. The collection features unique avatars based on the Ethereum blockchain with their distinct highlights.

Thanks to celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon flaunting their bored apes on different digital platforms, the trading volume of BAYC collection has doubled unconditionally. As of March 2022, the overall trading volume of BAYC amounted to almost $1.4 billion, thereby showcasing a promising future. </p>

The project was launched in June 2017 by the Larva Labs studio,[1] a two-person team consisting of Canadian software developers Matt Hall and John Watkinson. The experimental project was inspired by the London punk scenes, the cyberpunk movement,[2] and electronic music artists Daft Punk. The crypto art blockchain project was an inspiration for the ERC-721 standard for NFTs and the modern crypto art movement, which has since become a part of the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance ecosystems on multiple blockchains.

All the NFTs in the CryptoPunks collection feature some unique highlights, which help in determining their value.

When a transaction is verified, a new block is opened, and a Bitcoin is created and given as a reward to the miner(s) who verified the data within the block—they are then free to use it, hold it, or sell it.

It was launched during an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017 and has a strict maximum of 200 million BNB tokens.

This means that they don’t act as currencies but are used to create avatars, wearables, and unique parcels of land
                  MANA is an ERC-20 fungible token that serves as Decentrand’s digital currency.

In the future, SAND will also serve as a governance token, allowing its holders to have input on changes to the ecosystem when The Sandbox DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is established.
                  SAND can also be used to purchase ASSETS and LANDS, digital pieces of real estate which are represented by ERC-721 tokens, which are NFTs.

                <p class="p-topics"><p>If you were to close your eyes, fall asleep, and wake up on July 6, 2016, you would rise to find that the price of bitcoin was trading between $670 and $681, the iPhone SE was the newest phone in town, and the soon-to-be-craze known as Pokémon GO was just being released. For many, this probably sounds like a lifetime ago. it is astonishing to think about how much technological change has occurred in six short years.About one year later, in December 2017, the idea to combine aspects of the crypto universe with online gaming would come to life in the minds of the people at Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis.In the article below, we’ll look at the online game known as Axie Infinity, discuss what it is, and talk about how it has been evolving since the start of development in 2017.
                </p>
                <img class="img-projects" src="media/meta5.png" alt="metaverse">
                <p class="p-topics"><p>Axie Infinity is an online game universe revolving around Pokémon-esque creatures known as Axies. Players can collect Axies as virtual pets with aspirations to battle, breed, collect, raise, and build kingdoms for their Axies. What makes Axie Infinity different from other online games is the synergy it has established between standard online gaming and blockchain. The Ethereum-based game utilizes a design that allows players to own their virtual assets and rewards players who are able to reach an advanced level of skill.To get started, users need to work through a multistep setup process to connect digital wallets and their Axie Infinity account, which is all detailed in the game’s onboarding guide.
                </p>
                <img class="img-projects" src="media/meta6.png" alt="metaverse">
                <p class="p-topics">Once the accounts are successfully connected, the player can interact with the digital marketplace. To play, users need three Axies. Once the player has three Axies, they can download the application and start playing. There is a lot of nuance around the cost of an Axie since the average price that is paid fluctuates based on factors such as rarity, experience, attributes, and type. As of this writing, the least expensive Axies, known as “Floor Axies,” cost around $30. Floor Axies are often weak in battle and likely won’t be able to earn much for its owner. As of this writing, players can expect to pay a few hundred U.S. dollars for a usable team of Axies and upward of $1,000 for a rare Mystic Axie.<br>
                  Axie Infinity is recognized as the leader in non-fungible token (NFT) gaming. In-game digital assets such as the Axie creatures are represented by NFTs. These cryptographically unique tokens, as discussed, confer ownership and allow the player to trade Axies on the game’s marketplace for real money.
                  In the realm of NFT projects, Axie Infinity holds the record for the third-highest all-time sales. As of March 2022, Axie Infinity generated $4.17 billion in all-time NFT sales, below OpenSea’s $23.21 billion and LooksRare’s reported $18 billion.
