            <p id="p-topics">Nowdays we started to hear a lot of new terms that are related to the <b>WEB3</b> like : <b>METAVERSE NFTS CRYPTO ... ,</b> and they seem to be hard to understand.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-topics">WEB 3.0</h2>
                <p class="p-topics">Web 3.0 is a possible future version of the internet based on public blockchains, a record-keeping system best known for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions.
                  The attractiveness of Web 3.0 is that it is decentralized, meaning that rather than consumers accessing the internet through services mediated by companies like Google, Apple or Facebook, individuals, themselves, own and govern sections of the internet.<br>
                  Web 3.0 doesn't require "permission," which means that central authorities don't get to decide who gets to access what services, nor does it require "trust," meaning that an intermediary isn't necessary for virtual transactions to occur between two or more parties. Because these agencies and intermediaries are doing most of the data collection, Web 3.0 technically protects user privacy better.

                <h2 class="h2-topics"> CRYPTO</h2>
                <p class="p-topics">Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.
                </p>
                <img class="img-topics" src="media/crypto 1.jpg" alt="some cryptocurrencies">
                <p class="p-topics">Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.<br>
                  Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.</p>

                <p class="p-topics">The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.</p>

                <p class="p-topics">NFTs are currently taking the digital art and collectables world by storm. Just as everyone worldwide believed Bitcoin was the digital answer to currency, NFTs are now pitched as the digital answer to collectibles. Asa result, digital artists are seeing their lives changing thanks to the massive sales to a new crypto audience.<br>
                  If you are interested in NFTs and want to explore more about what they are, you have come to the right place. Let’s dive in and see what all the fuss is about!

                <h2 class="h2-topics">METAVERSE</h2>
                <p class="p-topics">Technically, a metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical and digital reality. For simplicity’s sake, think of a metaverse as the next iteration of the internet, which started as individual bulletin boards and independent online destinations. Eventually these destinations became sites on a virtual shared space — similar to how a metaverse will develop.</p>
                <img class="img-topics" src="media/meta 1.jpg" alt="metaverse">
                <p class="p-topics">A metaverse is not device-independent, nor owned by a single vendor. It is an independent virtual economy, enabled by digital currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
                <img class="img-topics" src="media/meta 2.jpg" alt="meta-logo">
                <p class="p-topics">As a combinatorial innovation, metaverses require multiple technologies and trends to function. Contributing trends include virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), flexible work styles, head-mounted displays (HMDs), an AR cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, artificial intelligence (AI) and spatial computing.<br>
                  There is a lot of excitement around metaverse, driven by technology companies preemptively claiming to be metaverse companies or creating a metaverse to enhance or augment the digital and physical realities of people.</p>
